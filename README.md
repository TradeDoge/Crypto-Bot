As a seasoned software developer with 14 and a half years of experience, I specialize in Java and C++ programming languages. I am passionate about contributing to open source projects and am particularly interested in decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges and open source AI. If anyone requires assistance with any of my open source projects, please feel free to reach out to me. I am always willing to help others and believe in giving back to the community. I currently run a small software development company in Connecticut, where I reside after being born in the Bronx.

I am currently working on an open source project related to triangular arbitrage between multiple decentralized exchanges. The project is fully functional and has proven to be highly effective. It searches for profitable trades and executes them, resulting in a profit for the user. I conducted a closed test run for 30 days, starting with 1.89 Ethereum, and ended with 23.62 Ethereum, which I consider a success. It is important to note that this is the only official GitHub for version 4 of the project and it is completely free. A tester was nice enough to make this YouTube tutorial for the project with step-by-step 
The results of the program's execution have been compiled over a period of approximately 28 days.
